# fbot
Autonomous Factorio bot.

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/ProkopRandacek/fbot)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/ProkopRandacek/fbot)

## Status
The interaction with Factorio world is pretty much done. We can create a factory for any item, do space management, place belts from A to B, etc.  

## TODO
- Early game logic

## Bugs
- Starting the bot while the cut scene is running and then skipping the cut scene causes desync error.
